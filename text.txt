In fact, the cardiovascular system is not only responsible for delivering blood and oxygen, but also for transporting nutrients,
hormones, and waste throughout the body. All of these are carried in the blood, of which an average adult has about 5 liters.
The heart acts as a pump that circulates blood through the arteries, capillaries, and veins. It is interesting to note that if these
were laid end-to-end, the estimated length would be 100,000 km.
Our next system, the digestive system, is closely linked to the cardiovascular system as, on one hand, it requires about 30%
of all cardiac output. On the other hand, the digestive system separates nutrients from food before they can be distributed via
the cardiovascular system. Thus, as with the relationship between the CNS and the cardiovascular system, each system
needs the other to work.
When thinking about the digestive system, the first organ that comes to mind is usually the stomach, but surprisingly, this is
not the largest organ in this system. That is the liver, which is actually the largest solid organ in the body. The liver performs
several functions among which are cleaning the blood, producing digestive liquids (bile), and storing sugar. Again, we can
see examples of cross-system relationships here.
As well as the liver and stomach, the digestive system is also made up of the pancreas and the intestine The pancreas, like
the liver, aids in the digestion of food. After food has passed through the stomach and has been ground into tiny pieces, it
enters the small intestine, where the bile is added and the nutrients are extracted from the food. Waste products then move
further down the large intestine. Now, donâ€™t forget to join me next week when we will examine the tonsils and other glands.
